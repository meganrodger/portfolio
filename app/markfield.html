<p>Markfield is a community centre that holds activities and classes for autistic adults and children, as well as hosting a huge outdoor adventure area that has been thoughtfully created with the needs of an autistic child. The building is a converted water mill in North London and due to the fact it was not been built for purpose, it has a lot of limitations that cause frustration for the staff and users. I was part of a two week architecture and design workshop called ‘Designing Empathy’ that was brought in to create suggestions for small transformations that could make the space better suited to its users.</p>

<p>The course was run by Muf Architecture, an architecture and design practice that focuses on social infrastructure and accessibility. The idea was that we conduct some experimental design and research exercises, all within the space and with the staff and community of Markfield, to try and develop higher levels of empathy whilst designing.  This involved yoga and meditation every morning, art workshops with the staff, rapid observation exercises with a writer, rudimentary graphic design tasks, and acting and improv workshops.</p>

<p>The outcomes of all of these activities interspersed with prototyping, both model size and 1:1, was presented back to the the users throughout the process, finishing in a final show and tell. The success of truly understanding the different users of the building was clear as we began to feed back to them, and from the proposals designs have been chosen, mine one of them, to implement over the next few months. I continue to be involved in this project as it moves into the next phase.</p>
