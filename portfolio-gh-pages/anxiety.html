<p>Brief:  To create some form of physical processing that uses real-time data</p>
<p>With only one week to research, prototype and learn how to implement processing that could pair up with an arduino, I drew upon a user, or small set of users, that I knew a lot about. I had suffered from anxiety attacks, and spoken to other peers who had similar experiences, and one of things that is most striking during these attacks is regaining control of your breathing and heart rate, often easier if being slightly taken out of your responsibility.</p>

<p>initial low fidelity prototypes</p>
</div>

<p>I rapidly prototyped roughly different ways that this concept could be quickly put into realisation, looking at something that could press into your palm and sit in your hand, but for our first iteration wanted to keep it as something that was more indicative of air and lungs so developed a way of creating a light inflatable lung-like structure with very thin sheets of plastic.
</p>

<p>development sketches of 'device'</p>
</div>

<p>Restricted by what APIs were the most accessible to us, though also having experienced the persisting urge to keep checking a twitter feed, or instagram, I began to create a small piece of processing script that would continuously run every 15 seconds, looking for trigger words being mentioned in your news feed; if it got to six of any of the specified words, a fan under the ‘lung’ would turn on and off in the rate of slow breathing to inflate and relax it. Though there are some huge gaps in research, and assumptions that went into this device, it acted as a high fidelity prototype to start discussions and gather feedback on.</p>
