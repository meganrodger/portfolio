          <p>I have been working at the Home Office Digital as an interaction designer for the past 9 months. I have become an embedded member of the Home Office Digital community; presenting at both cross-government events and internal show and tells, sitting in on service assessments, and sharing skills in training sessions. On the teams I have been a part of, I have contributed to a close collaborative relationship between the researchers, developers, business analysts and other designers, key for a successful delivery team. Due to the nature of the work I am restricted by what I can show here, but I have picked out examples where I have had a particular impact on projects, or within the home office design community.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #999999;">MAPPING</span></h3>
  </div>
    <p>I have been brought into different teams to assist mapping complex systems and passing of information. In all instances untangling and creating a readable visual form of the services, enabling stakeholders to be brought up to speed, and time and money-saving decisions to be made.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #999999; ">VISUAL COMMUNICATION</h3>
</div>
    <p>Good visual communication is key to ensure that ideas are understood clearly by people especially when asking them to commit to a proposal or a  way of thinking. During my time at the Home Office I have created posters, presentations and training material for various people, in my delivery team, and for the wider Home Office Digital. This set below for service designer Kate Tarling, has been shared extensively to communicate clearly the key points of each agile delivery stage; discovery, alpha, beta, live.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #999999; ">COLLABORATIVE SERVICE DESIGN</span></h3></div>
    <p>I have been a key member of cross-discipline teams; working to come to a solution, see the crux of the problem or the wider view of the problem area, especially when participating in workshops or meetings.  Most recently on an internal service that where the user needs and greater service needs hadn’t been understood, I helped draw them out for an end of phase ‘health check’ which is forming a basis of our key performance indicators. The process of finding how the needs of different people and different levels could be met, meant defining and redefining the user and constantly championing agile practices to preserve their needs remaining at the core of the service, and how success would be measured.

    <h3 style="color: #999999; ">RAPID PROTOTYPING</span></h3></div>

    <p>A large part of being an interaction designer at Home Office Digital, is being able to take research insights and pull them together in a design or prototype that can then be tested to learn even more. I have filled this role on both internal and external services, where the user doesn’t interact with the website in the way that you have expected due to previous practiced behaviours. I have rapidly prototyped alternative versions after assisting user research, that then have helped us interrogate how they are understanding the page, or even specific interactions.</p>
